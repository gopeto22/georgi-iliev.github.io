This lightweight, accessible personal site showcases my work on **Generative AI for real-time, personalised performance nutrition** — integrating multi-modal athlete context (GPS, LSTM-predicted HR, environment, wellness) with PEFT/LoRA, schema-bound generation, and practitioner-in-the-loop RLHF. It also links directly to my CV, thesis, and NutriElite materials.

## What I focused on
- Semantic, accessible HTML with a skip link and keyboard-friendly controls
- Dark and light themes that follow the system preference
- Mobile-first responsive layout with a clean two-column hero on desktop
- Icon-based top navigation and a direct PDF CV link
- SEO metadata and schema.org Person markup
